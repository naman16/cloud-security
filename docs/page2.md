- **Prioritize CSPM Offering:** Focus on vendors with strong capabilities in the areas most critical to your organization's needs and cloud security strategy.
    - Prioritize vendors that have strong CSPM, vulnerability scanning, and CIEM capabilities, even if the rest of their features may not be as robust.
    - Ensure that if not already supported, vendors have it in their short-term plan to provide support for the remaining CNAPP capabilities (CWPP, DSPM, attack surface management, software supply chain, policy-as-code (PaC), container image scanning, etc.).
